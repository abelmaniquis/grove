Concept
===========
When I was a young teenager, I had an aol instant messenger account that I
used to chat with friends, when I was a little older, I got a Myspace account,
and then in my twenties, like most of my peers, I found myself on Facebook.

Now, Social Media has become a driving force in our culture, it has affected
how we keep in touch, get our news, and more recently, how we vote in elections.
It has also raised concerns about Big Data and our privacy.

I have observed that the profitability of social web apps comes first and foremost from the data that
they collect from users. This is what advertisers use to target their ads, and what companies
use to track trends.

This is a demo of a social networking site, that allows users to post updates on a wall, 
tracks when those updates are made, and allows for chat functionality. Everything that
the user does will be stored in mongoDB objects.

*A note on humor
I have a very dry sense of humor, and have an interest in conspiracy theories. Although
I don't particularly believe in most conspiracy theories, I find them to be fascinating,
in particular the idea that the Illuminati/Bilderberg/Skull and Bones Society/Trilateral Commission/
Shadow Government would leave clues of its diabolical schemes all over the world. I decided that,
going with the theme of privacy and data concerns, to go leave Bohemian Grove/Illuminati themes
scattered throughout the app, because I have a dry sense of humor and it seemed appropriate.

This is an ongoing project, and there are many features that I hope to implement.
