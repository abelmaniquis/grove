Project:

Grove: For your world domination plans.
           Your own personal illuminati.
           Your own personal cabal.

A cabal is a group of people united in some close design together, 
usually to promote their private views or interests in a church, 
state, or other community, often by intrigue, usually unbeknown to 
persons outside their group.

Grove allows you and up to 9 other friends to plan and conspire
together. It's your own personal Illuminati!

Features will include:
   Exclusive membership:
          -Everyone in the group shares a single password. It's better for the sake of loyalty.
          -In fact, there are two passwords for you to join, your personal password, and a group password.
          -Your group is exclusive, you can only be part of one group at a time
   Chat:
          
VERSION 1:

For now, the app will simply be a chatroom that requires password access
