On the onset, it seems that this is just a simple chatroom application, it appears to be that way,
after all, I started writing this app with the intent of creating my own version of a social networking
site. It was useful for learning Node.js, and MongoDB.

The user object 

Initially, I wasn't too happy with the project, after all the goal was to build an app that does something interesting.

I tested the chatroom with a friend, and when checking the database on MongoDB, discovered that I had not
been hashing passwords correctly. I then proceeded to fix my Bcrypt functions in my user object and continued building the app.

However, this moment planted a sort of seed inside of my mind, and that's when the app started to become a little more
... insidious, and perhaps kind of creepy.

This is my personal experiment on how an app can harvest user data, and my own attempt to further understand
a relevant issue in today's society.

I created a social networking site that demonstrates this ability.

So yes, you can say that this app is useful.
